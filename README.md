# Homework-Challenge-5

This week's project is a working-day calendar (follows standard working hours (9am-5pm, 09-17)) that allows you to input events into blocks that are allocated for each time of the working day. The calendar is also color-coded to tell you when the event occurs (past (gray), present (red), future (green)). Finally, you can press the save button on the side to save your events to the local storage for it to remember in case your accidentally refresh the page or something else along those lines.
